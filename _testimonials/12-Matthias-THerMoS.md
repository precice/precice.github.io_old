We are developing [a tool](https://www.lrg.tum.de/lrt/forschung/exploration-technologies/thermos/) for simulation of temperatures on the surface of the Moon including rovers and astronaut operating on the lunar surface. Ray tracing on a single or multiple GPUs with NVIDIA Optix calculates the heat transfer by radiation between surface elements while a MATLAB routine solves the equation of heat diffusion. preCICE couples both domains and provides communication abilities between MATLAB and NVIDIA Optix. Other solvers and simulation approaches instead of MATLAB and NVIDIA Optix are going to be tested in the future with the flexibility that preCICE offers.
