OpenFOAM is a free/open-source (GPL) collection of free/open-source Finite Volume solvers mainly for CFD.
Today, there are two major "flavors" of OpenFOAM, one developed by the OpenFOAM Foundation ([openfoam.org](https://openfoam.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenFOAM)) and one developed by the [ESI Group](https://www.esi-group.com/) ([openfoam.com](https://www.openfoam.com/), [GitLab](https://develop.openfoam.com/)).
