[EFD](https://github.com/precice/efd) was a free/open-source "Eulerian finite difference (EFD) fluid solver", which was coupled to preCICE. It was developed at the [Chair of Scientific Computing of the Technical University of Munich](https://www5.in.tum.de/). This solver is not maintained anymore and does not work with the current version of preCICE.
